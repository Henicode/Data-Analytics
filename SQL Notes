Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

SQL Keywords are not case sensetive. 

Some SQL important commands are : 
                                    SELECT - extracts data from a database
                                    UPDATE - updates data in a database
                                    DELETE - deletes data from a database
                                    INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
                                    CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
                                    ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
                                    CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
                                    ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
                                    DROP TABLE - deletes a table
                                    CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
                                    DROP INDEX - deletes an index
                                    DISTINCT - used to return only distinct (different) values.
                                    WHERE - used to filter records. you can use WHERE clause for comparison (+,-,/,*,<,>,exc) and also use
                                            BETWEEN (Between a certain range), LIKE (Search for a pattern), IN (To specify multiple possible values for a column).
                                          - WHERE clause can be combined with AND operator (displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.),
                                                  OR operator (displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE) , and
                                                  NOT operator (displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE).
                                    ORDER BY - used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. it sort the result ascending by default or (ORDER BY Country ASC),
                                              To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword (ORDER BY Country DESC;).
                                   INSERT INTO - used to insert new records in a table. Ex. INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
                                                                                            VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');
                                   NULL value is a field with no value or empty. You can test test the value by calling IS NULL or IS NOT NULL to determine if value is stored.
                                   UPDATE - used to modify the existing records in a table. WHERE clause specifies which record(s) that should be updated.
                                          - If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!
                                          - EX - UPDATE Customers
                                                 SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
                                                 WHERE CustomerID = 1;
                                                 




Data stucture is a collection of data stored in format that can easily be accessed .
to manage our data, we use to DBMS (database management system). two types of datbase management. 1. relational 2. non relational(nonsql).

We have to follow the order of clause. we cannot change it. so they go as:
SELECT 
FROM
WHERE 
ORDER 

SELECT statment- used to select data from a database. you can specify where you want to select by (SELECT customers) or you can select all by using (SELECT *)
FROM - used to specif which table to select or delete data form.  (FROM customers)
WHERE clause- to filter data . (ex- WHERE points > 200)
ORDER BY - used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. (ex. ORDER BY first_name)

AS- command is used to rename a column or table with an alias. (ex. FROM points - 20 AS discounted_price ) .you can use AS to assign the arithmetic expression a name 


 ----------------------------------------------------------------EXC-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
return products with quantity in stock euqal to 49, 78, 32 ??
SELECT *
FROM products 
WHERE quantity_in_stock in ('49','78','32')

return customers born between 1/1/1990 - 1/1/2000 ???

SELECT * 
FROM, customers
WHERE date_of_birth between '1990/01/01' and '2000/01/01'

get customers whos address contain avenue or trail, and phone number end with 9

SELECT *
FROM customers 
Where address like '%avenue%' or
      address like '%trail%' and 
      phone_number like '%9'
      
      
  get the customers whos.  first names are ELKA or AMBUR
  last names end with EY or ON 
  last names start with MY or contains SE 
  last names contain B followed by R or U
  
  SELECT * 
  FROM customers 
  WHERE first_name REGEXP 'elka | ambur'
  WHERE last_name REGEXP 'ey$ | on$;
  WHERE last_name REGEXP '^my|se'
  WHERE last-name REGEXP 'b[ri]'
