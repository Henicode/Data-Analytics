Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

Data stucture is a collection of data stored in format that can easily be accessed .
to manage our data, we use to DBMS (database management system). two types of datbase management. 1. relational 2. non relational(nonsql).

We have to follow the order of clause. we cannot change it. so they go as:
SELECT 
FROM
WHERE 
ORDER 

SELECT statment- used to select data from a database. you can specify where you want to select by (SELECT customers) or you can select all by using (SELECT *)
FROM - used to specif which table to select or delete data form.  (FROM customers)
WHERE clause- to filter data . (ex- WHERE points > 200)
ORDER BY - used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order. (ex. ORDER BY first_name)

AS- command is used to rename a column or table with an alias. (ex. FROM points - 20 AS discounted_price ) .you can use AS to assign the arithmetic expression a name
