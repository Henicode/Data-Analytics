Cloud Computing
Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to
    compute power meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
    storage like files and/or databases
    networking in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
    analytics services for visualization and telemetry data


Key concepts
    scalability is the ability to scale, so allocate(adding) and deallocate(removing) resources at any time
    elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically (Automatic Scaling)
    agility is the ability to react (allocate and deallocate) fast (scale quickly)
    fault tolerance is the ability to remain up and running during component and service failures 
    disaster recovery is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters (it creates 2 copies of the same application into your regions)
    high availability is the ability to keep services running for extended periods of time with little downtime 
    availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime). - measure of system uptime for users/services
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Economies of Scale
    Refers to the cost saving that result from the incresed use of azure services. 
    As more customers use Azure, the costs assosciated with running and maintaing the services can be spread out over a larger user base,
       resulting in lower costs for each user. 
    The principle of economies of scale states that as the companies grow they become more effective at managing shared operations.

                        Capital Expenditure	(buying)                         Operational Expenditure (renting)
              
Up front cost	               Significant	                                          None
Ongoing cost	               Low	                                              Based on usage
Tax Deduction	             Over time	                                            Same year

Value over time	               Lowers	                                              No change

CapEx is buying own infrastructure, can use server capacity until full while also managing your own infrasture which requires 
         maintenance of support staff, power, networking, hardware failures and others
OpEx is renting infrastrucute, only pay for what is used with no inital investment and requires minimal maintenance 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a consumption-based model?
The consumption-based model is a pricing model used in the cloud so that customers are only charged based on their resource usage.
   - no upfront costs 
   - no wasted resources 
   - pay for additional resources when needed 
   - stop paying at any time 

This model is characterized by
            No associated upfront cost
            No wasted resources 
            Pay for what you need
            Stop paying when you donâ€™t
  Consumption is the virtual metric used to calculate how much each resource (service) in Azure was used. 
            Each service has many smaller metrics that track its consumption to offer best possible pricing model. 
            Those metrics are tracked on very granular level.

    You manage nothing 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Public Cloud : environment where the infrastructure and services are owned and operated by a third-party provider (aws, azure,...)
    - Everything runs on cloud provider hardware
    - No local hardware 
    - Some services share hardware with other customers
          Advantage - no CapEx, High availability & agility, pay as you go pricing, no hardware maintenace, No deep technical skills required 
          Disadvantages- Security & compliance, Ownership
Private Cloud : environment where the infrastructure and services are dedicated to a single organization and typically reside within the organization's
                own data center
    - Eveything runs on your own datacenter
    - Self-service should be provided 
    - You maintain the hardware
          Advantage - control over security, meet any security and compliance
          Disadvantae - inital CapEx, limited agility, IT skills and expertise are mandatory
Hybrid Cloud : combination of public and private clouds, where organizations can run some workloads on the public cloud and others on the private cloud
    - Combines public & private clouds 
    - Great flexibility 
          Advantage - flexible, run legacy apps in private cloud, utilize exsisting infrastructure, meet any security requirements 
          Disadvantage - More expensive, complicated to manage, IT skills & expertise are mandatory
