Cloud Computing
Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to
    compute power meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
    storage like files and/or databases
    networking in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
    analytics services for visualization and telemetry data


Key concepts
    scalability is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
    elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically
    agility is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
    fault tolerance is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
    disaster recovery is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters
    high availability is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole
                      lifetime of the system.
    availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)

Economies of Scale
    The principle of economies of scale states that as the companies grow they become more effective at managing shared operations.
    Be that HR and hiring, taxes, accounting, internal operations, marketing, big purchases via contracts meaning better discounts, etc. etc.
    Because of those, companies can save/earn more which in return allows for reduction in cost of their services to their customers.
    This is so called ‘price per unit’.
    It’s not possible to go to 0 because in the end some underlying infrastructure needs to run to provide the services.
    But the larger the scale the more benefits can be passed to customers.
    In fact, in the current scale, Microsoft can already offer multiple services for free due to how small a fraction of the cost it is for them.
