There are two ways to filter on a column name:
Method 1: Quick and easy, but only works if the column name does NOT have spaces or special characters.

    df.column_name               # returns series
Method 2: More robust, and can filter on multiple columns.

    df['column']                  # returns series
    df[['column 1', 'column 2']]  # returns dataframe

------------------------------------------

There are main 2 ways to select rows:

    df.loc[label]    # filters by the labels of the index/column
    df.iloc[index]   # filters by the positions of the index/column

-------------------------------------------\

So each row consists of 13 features:
            IncidntNum: Incident Number
            Category: Category of crime or incident
            Descript: Description of the crime or incident
            DayOfWeek: The day of week on which the incident occurred
            Date: The Date on which the incident occurred
            Time: The time of day on which the incident occurred
            PdDistrict: The police department district
            Resolution: The resolution of the crime in terms whether the perpetrator was arrested or not
            Address: The closest address to where the incident took place
            X: The longitude value of the crime location
            Y: The latitude value of the crime location
            Location: A tuple of the latitude and the longitude values
            PdId: The police department ID
