There are two ways to filter on a column name:
Method 1: Quick and easy, but only works if the column name does NOT have spaces or special characters.

    df.column_name               # returns series
Method 2: More robust, and can filter on multiple columns.

    df['column']                  # returns series
    df[['column 1', 'column 2']]  # returns dataframe

------------------------------------------

There are main 2 ways to select rows:

    df.loc[label]    # filters by the labels of the index/column
    df.iloc[index]   # filters by the positions of the index/column

-------------------------------------------\

So each row consists of 13 features:
            IncidntNum: Incident Number
            Category: Category of crime or incident
            Descript: Description of the crime or incident
            DayOfWeek: The day of week on which the incident occurred
            Date: The Date on which the incident occurred
            Time: The time of day on which the incident occurred
            PdDistrict: The police department district
            Resolution: The resolution of the crime in terms whether the perpetrator was arrested or not
            Address: The closest address to where the incident took place
            X: The longitude value of the crime location
            Y: The latitude value of the crime location
            Location: A tuple of the latitude and the longitude values
            PdId: The police department ID

Best dashboards answer critical business questions. It will help business make informed decisions, thereby improving performance. 

- Dashboards can produce real-time visuals. 
- Plotly is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 chart types. 
- The web based visualizations created using Plotly python can be displayed in Jupyter notebook, saved to standalone HTML files, or served as part of pure Python-built web applications using Dash. 
- Plotly Graph Objects is the low-level interface to figures, traces, and layout whereas plotly express is a high-level wrapper for Plotly. 
- Dash is an Open-Source User Interface Python library for creating reactive, web-based applications. It is both enterprise-ready and a first-class member of Plotlyâ€™s open-source tools. 
- Core and HTML are the two components of dash. 
- The dash_html_components library has a component for every HTML tag. 
- The dash_core_components describe higher-level components that are interactive and are generated with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library. 
- A callback function is a python function that is automatically called by Dash whenever an input component's property changes. Callback function is decorated with `@app.callback` decorator. 
- Callback decorator function takes two parameters: Input and Output. Input and Output to the callback function will have component id and component property. Multiple inputs or outputs should be enclosed inside either a list or tuple.
