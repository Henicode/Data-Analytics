There are two ways to filter on a column name:
Method 1: Quick and easy, but only works if the column name does NOT have spaces or special characters.

    df.column_name               # returns series
Method 2: More robust, and can filter on multiple columns.

    df['column']                  # returns series
    df[['column 1', 'column 2']]  # returns dataframe

------------------------------------------

There are main 2 ways to select rows:

    df.loc[label]    # filters by the labels of the index/column
    df.iloc[index]   # filters by the positions of the index/column
