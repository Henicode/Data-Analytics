Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.

You’ll always be responsible for:
.The information and data stored in the cloud
.Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
.The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:
.The physical datacenter
.The physical network
.The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:
.Operating systems
.Network controls
.Applications
.Identity and infrastructure

The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.


Public Cloud : A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. 
           .No capital expenditures to scale up
           .Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
           .Organizations pay only for what they use	
           .Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security	
Private Cloud : A private cloud is a type of cloud computing infrastructure that is dedicated to a single organization. 
           .Organizations have complete control over resources and security
           .Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data	
           .Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance	
           .Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates	
Hybrid Cloud : A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment.
           .Provides the most flexibility
           .Organizations determine where to run their applications
           .Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements

A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers.
Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

There are two types of IT Infranstructure models, Capital expenditure (CapEX) and Operational expenditure (OpEx)
CapEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources.
       A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
OpEx is spending money on services or products over time.
       Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model.
   With this cosumption-based model, it has benefits including :                    
                                            .No upfront costs.
                                            .No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
                                            .The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
                                            .The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
                                                                  .Plan and manage your operating costs.
                                                                  .Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
                                                                  .Scale as your business needs change.


In conclusion, cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else’s datacenter.
You can treat cloud resources like you would resources in your own datacenter.
However, unlike in your own datacenter, when you're done using cloud resources, you give them back. You’re billed only for what you use.

                               ---------------------------------------------------------
Scalability - the ability to increase or decrease resources for a given workload. 
Reliability - the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
Predictability - refers to the ability to plan for and manage the performance and capacity of a cloud service or application.
  In other words, reliability is about the system being up and running, whereas predictability is about being able to predict the system performance
  and capacity usage.
