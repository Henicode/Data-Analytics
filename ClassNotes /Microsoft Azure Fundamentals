Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.

You’ll always be responsible for:
.The information and data stored in the cloud
.Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
.The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:
.The physical datacenter
.The physical network
.The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:
.Operating systems
.Network controls
.Applications
.Identity and infrastructure

The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.


Public Cloud : A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. 
           .No capital expenditures to scale up
           .Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
           .Organizations pay only for what they use	
           .Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security	
Private Cloud : A private cloud is a type of cloud computing infrastructure that is dedicated to a single organization. 
           .Organizations have complete control over resources and security
           .Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data	
           .Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance	
           .Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates	
Hybrid Cloud : A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment.
           .Provides the most flexibility
           .Organizations determine where to run their applications
           .Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements

A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers.
Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment
Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability.


There are two types of IT Infranstructure models, Capital expenditure (CapEX) and Operational expenditure (OpEx)
CapEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources.
       A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
OpEx is spending money on services or products over time. pay-as-you-go
       Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model.
   With this cosumption-based model, it has benefits including :                    
                                            .No upfront costs.
                                            .No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
                                            .The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
                                            .The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
                                                                  .Plan and manage your operating costs.
                                                                  .Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
                                                                  .Scale as your business needs change.


In conclusion, cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else’s datacenter.
You can treat cloud resources like you would resources in your own datacenter.
However, unlike in your own datacenter, when you're done using cloud resources, you give them back. You’re billed only for what you use.

Availability - refer to a cloud-based service that focuses on providing high availability, or the ability for a system to remain operational and 
               accessible to users despite failures or disruptions.
Scalability - the ability to increase or decrease resources for a given workload. 
Reliability - the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
Predictability - refers to the ability to plan for and manage the performance and capacity of a cloud service or application.
  In other words, reliability is about the system being up and running, whereas predictability is about being able to predict the system performance
  and capacity usage.
Geodistribution refers to the practice of distributing data, resources, and services across multiple geographic locations.  
Disaster recovery (DR) is the process of restoring an organization's IT systems and infrastructure in the event of a disaster.
Manageability - refers to the ability to effectively manage and control the various resources and services that are deployed in a cloud environment.

IaaS(Infrastructure as a service) provides virtualized computing resources, such as servers and storage, over the internet. 
      Examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

PaaS(Platform as a service) provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications over the internet. 
      Examples of PaaS providers include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, and Google App Engine.
      Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for
         a complete and deployed solution (software as a service).     
      
SaaS(Software as a service) provides access to software applications over the internet. 
     Examples of SaaS providers include Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365, and Google G Suite.

                                 ---------------------------------------------------------
THE CORE ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENET OF AZURE 

.The physical infrastructure for Azure starts with datacenters. 
  Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters. 
  They’re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
.A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together
  with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.
.Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. 
  Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. 
  An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. 
  Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.
    Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.
    Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
           1. Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
           2. Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
           3. Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.

Region pair is a combination of two regions that are connected with low-latency, high-throughput network connections within 300 miles.
  These region pairs are designed to provide a high-availability and disaster recovery solution for applications and data that need to be replicated 
  across regions.
Additional advantages of region pairs:
.If an extensive Azure outage occurs, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible for
    applications hosted in that region pair.
.Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.
.Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax- and law-enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

Sovereign regions in Azure are regions that are physically located within a specific country or territory and operated by a subsidiary or partner
 of Microsoft, rather than by Microsoft itself. 
 
Azure sovereign regions include:
1. US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government
    agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications.
2. China East, China North, and more: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn't
    directly maintain the datacenters.

A resource is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. 
    Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.

Some examples of how you could use management groups might be:
1. Create a hierarchy that applies a policy. You could limit VM locations to the US West Region in a group called Production. 
    This policy will inherit onto all the subscriptions that are descendants of that management group and will apply to all VMs under those subscriptions. 
    This security policy can't be altered by the resource or subscription owner, which allows for improved governance.
2. Provide user access to multiple subscriptions. By moving multiple subscriptions under a management group, you can create one Azure role-based access
    control (Azure RBAC) assignment on the management group. Assigning Azure RBAC at the management group level means that all sub-management groups, 
    subscriptions, resource groups, and resources underneath that management group would also inherit those permissions. One assignment on the management
    group can enable users to have access to everything they need instead of scripting Azure RBAC over different subscriptions.

AZURE COMPUTE AND NETWORKING SERVICES                                  


VMs are an ideal choice when you need:
                                 Total control over the operating system (OS).
                                 The ability to run custom software.
                                 To use custom hosting configurations.

A virtual machine scale set is a group of identical, load-balanced virtual machines in Azure that automatically increase or decrease in number based
     on demand. This allows for easy scaling of applications and services, and enables high availability and automatic patching and updates

Availability sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, 
      preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure.

Availability sets do this by grouping VMs in two ways: update domain and fault domain - 
.Update domain: The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one 
           update domain grouping will be offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain will be updated.
           An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.
.Fault domain: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an availability set will split your VMs
            across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains
            (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).


Some common examples or use cases for virtual machines include:
-During testing and development. VMs provide a quick and easy way to create different OS and application configurations. 
           Test and development personnel can then easily delete the VMs when they no longer need them.
-When running applications in the cloud. The ability to run certain applications in the public cloud as opposed to creating a traditional infrastructure
           to run them can provide substantial economic benefits. For example, an application might need to handle fluctuations in demand. Shutting 
           down VMs when
           you don't need them or quickly starting them up to meet a sudden increase in demand means you pay only for the resources you use.
-When extending your datacenter to the cloud: An organization can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a virtual network
           in Azure and adding VMs to that virtual network. Applications like SharePoint can then run on an Azure VM instead of running locally.
           This arrangement makes it easier or less expensive to deploy than in an on-premises environment.
-During disaster recovery: As with running certain types of applications in the cloud and extending an on-premises network to the cloud,
           you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery. If a primary datacenter fails, you can create VMs running
           on Azure to run your critical applications and then shut them down when the primary datacenter becomes operational again.

Azure Virtual Desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud. 
      It enables you to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location.

Containers are a virtualization environment. Much like running multiple virtual machines on a single physical host, you can run multiple containers
           on a single physical or virtual host. Containers are designed to allow you to respond to changes on demand. 
           With containers, you can quickly restart if there's a crash or hardware interruption. One of the most popular container engines is Docker
          
Azure Container Instances offer the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure; without having to manage any virtual machines or adopt any 
                 additional services. Azure Container Instances are a platform as a service (PaaS) offering.

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure.
       It allows you to build and run event-driven, scaleable and highly available applications without the need for provisioning and managing servers. 

Functions can be either stateless or stateful. When they're stateless (the default), they behave as if they're restarted every time they respond
          to an event. When they're stateful (called Durable Functions), a context is passed through the function to track prior activity.


Azure virtual networks and virtual subnets enable Azure resources, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to communicate with each other, 
             with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers. 

Azure virtual networks provide the following key networking capabilities:
           .Isolation and segmentation
           .Internet communications
           .Communicate between Azure resources
           .Communicate with on-premises resources
           .Route network traffic
           .Filter network traffic
           .Connect virtual networks
Azure virtual networking supports both public and private endpoints to enable communication between external or internal resources with other
    internal resources
           .Public endpoints have a public IP address and can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
           .Private endpoints exist within a virtual network and have a private IP address from within the address space of that virtual network.

You'll want to enable Azure resources to communicate securely with each other. You can do that in one of two ways:
           .Virtual networks can connect not only VMs but other Azure resources, such as the App Service Environment for Power Apps,
              Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure virtual machine scale sets.
           .Service endpoints can connect to other Azure resource types, such as Azure SQL databases and storage accounts. 
              This approach enables you to link multiple Azure resources to virtual networks to improve security and provide optimal routing
              between resources.

Communicate with on-premises resources refers to the ability of cloud-based systems, such as Azure Functions, to securely connect and interact
              with resources that are located on a customer's own physical premises, rather than in a cloud-based environment.

There are three mechanisms for you to achieve this connectivity:
           .Point-to-site virtual private network connections are from a computer outside your organization back into your corporate network.
                In this case, the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to connect to the Azure virtual network.
           .Site-to-site virtual private networks link your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network.
                In effect, the devices in Azure can appear as being on the local network. The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.
           .Azure ExpressRoute provides a dedicated private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet.
                ExpressRoute is useful for environments where you need greater bandwidth and even higher levels of security.

Azure DNS leverages the scope and scale of Microsoft Azure to provide numerous benefits, including:
                     . Reliability and performance - provide resiliency and high availability.                    
                     . Security - provides features such as:
                                                           1. Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control who has access to specific
                                                              actions for your organization.
                                                           2. Activity logs to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource or
                                                              to find an error when troubleshooting.
                                                           3. Resource locking to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource.
                                                              Locking prevents other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or
                                                              modifying critical resources.
                     . Ease of Use - Azure DNS can manage DNS records for your Azure services and provide DNS for your external resources as well 
                     . Customizable virtual networks - This feature allows you to use your own custom domain names in your private virtual networks                    
                     . Alias records - You can use an alias record set to refer to an Azure resource, such as an Azure public IP address,
                                        an Azure Traffic Manager profile, or an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoint.

Important*
( You can't use Azure DNS to buy a domain name. For an annual fee, you can buy a domain name by using App Service domains
or a third-party domain name registrar. Once purchased, your domains can be hosted in Azure DNS for record management. )


                                 ---------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIBE AZURE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE 

     COST MANAGEMENT IN AZURE


That OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors. Some of the impacting factors are:
     .Resource type - a manageable item that represents an azure service. 
     .Consumption - cloud payment model where you pay for the resources that you use during a billing cycle                                                      
     .Maintenance - process that includes updates, patches, and infrastructure improvements to keep Azure services running smoothly and securely.                                               
     .Geography - costs can vary based on the location of the data center hosting the service, taxes, and compliance regulations, tax,
                  and network traffic(cost of transfering service depending on location distance).     
     .Subscription type - Some Azure subscription types also include usage allowances, which affect costs.     
     .Azure Marketplace - lets you purchase resources from third-party vendors which affects operational expenditure 


The pricing calculator and the total cost of ownership (TCO) calculator are two calculators that help you understand potential Azure expenses. 

-Pricing calculator - designed to give you an estimate cost for provisoing resources in azure. 
                    - for impormation purpose only, price estimates.Nothing is provisioned when you add resources to calculator
-Total cost of ownership calculator - designed to help you compare the cost for running na op-premises infanstructure  compared to an azure cloud
                                       infrastructure.
 The main difference is pricing calculator allows you to estimate the cost of using a specific service, whereas TCO helps you estimate the overal cost
  ownership of serveice or product compared to other infanstructure over a certain period of time. 

Cost Management provides the ability to quickly check Azure resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets 
                that can be used to automate management of resources.
Cost analysis  provides a quick visual for your Azure costs that include different filtering system like billing cycle, region, resource.
Cost alert is a trigger that notifies when cost of resource exceed a specified threshold.
            There are three main alerts :
                   .Budget alerts - notify you when spending reaches or exceeds the amount defined in the alert condition of the budget.                   
                   .Credit alerts - notify you when your Azure credit monetary commitments (set amout of money user can spend on services) are consumed.                    
                   .Department spending quota alert - notify you when department spending reaches a fixed threshold of the quota.


One way to organize related resources is to place them in their own subscriptions.
Another way is by Resource tags to help organize resources. Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources.
This metadata is useful for:
           .Resource management - Tags enable you to locate and act on resources that are associated with specific workloads, 
                                 environments, business units, and owners.
           .Cost management and optimization - Tags enable you to group resources so that you can report on costs, allocate internal cost centers,
                                 track budgets, and forecast estimated cost.
           .Operations management - Tags enable you to group resources according to how critical their availability is to your business. 
                                 This grouping helps you formulate service-level agreements (SLAs). An SLA is an uptime or performance guarantee
                                 between you and your users.
           .Security - Tags enable you to classify data by its security level, such as public or confidential.
           .Governance and regulatory compliance - Tags enable you to identify resources that align with governance or 
                                 regulatory compliance requirements
                                 For example, you might require that all resources be tagged with an owner or department name.
           .Workload optimization and automation - Tags can help you visualize all of the resources that participate in complex deployments.
                                 For example, you might tag a resource with its associated workload or application name and use software such 
                                 as Azure DevOps to perform automated tasks on those resources.

You can add, modify, or delete resource tags through Windows PowerShell, the Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager templates,
    the REST API, or the Azure portal.


                                 ---------------------------------------------------------
AZURE ARCHITECTURE AND SERVICES 
STORAGE SERVICE 


Azure Storage always stores multiple copies of your data so that it's protected from planned and unplanned events such as transient hardware failures,
             network or power outages, and natural disasters.
             
Redundancy ensures that your storage account meets its availability and durability targets even in the face of failures.
These are list of redundancy options :
     .Locally redundant storage (LRS) - replicates your data three times within a single data center in the primary region.
                                      - lowest-cost redundancy option and offers the least durability compared to other options.           
     .Geo-redundant storage (GRS) -1. copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS
                                   2. copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region (region pair) using LRS
     .Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) - combines the high availability provided by redundancy across availability zones with protection from regional
                                          outages provided by geo-replication.     
     .Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) - replicates your Azure Storage data synchronously across three Azure availability zones in the primary region.           
     .Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS) -
     .Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS)
