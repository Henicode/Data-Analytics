Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.

You’ll always be responsible for:
.The information and data stored in the cloud
.Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
.The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:
.The physical datacenter
.The physical network
.The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:
.Operating systems
.Network controls
.Applications
.Identity and infrastructure

The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.


Public Cloud : A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. 
           .No capital expenditures to scale up
           .Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
           .Organizations pay only for what they use	
           .Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security	
Private Cloud : A private cloud is a type of cloud computing infrastructure that is dedicated to a single organization. 
           .Organizations have complete control over resources and security
           .Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data	
           .Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance	
           .Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates	
Hybrid Cloud : A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment.
           .Provides the most flexibility
           .Organizations determine where to run their applications
           .Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements

A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers.
Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

There are two types of IT Infranstructure models, Capital expenditure (CapEX) and Operational expenditure (OpEx)
CapEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources.
       A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
OpEx is spending money on services or products over time.
       Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model.
   With this cosumption-based model, it has benefits including :                    
                                            .No upfront costs.
                                            .No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
                                            .The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
                                            .The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
                                                                  .Plan and manage your operating costs.
                                                                  .Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
                                                                  .Scale as your business needs change.


In conclusion, cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else’s datacenter.
You can treat cloud resources like you would resources in your own datacenter.
However, unlike in your own datacenter, when you're done using cloud resources, you give them back. You’re billed only for what you use.

Availability - refer to a cloud-based service that focuses on providing high availability, or the ability for a system to remain operational and 
               accessible to users despite failures or disruptions.
Scalability - the ability to increase or decrease resources for a given workload. 
Reliability - the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
Predictability - refers to the ability to plan for and manage the performance and capacity of a cloud service or application.
  In other words, reliability is about the system being up and running, whereas predictability is about being able to predict the system performance
  and capacity usage.
Geodistribution refers to the practice of distributing data, resources, and services across multiple geographic locations.  
Disaster recovery (DR) is the process of restoring an organization's IT systems and infrastructure in the event of a disaster.
Manageability - refers to the ability to effectively manage and control the various resources and services that are deployed in a cloud environment.

IaaS(Infrastructure as a service) provides virtualized computing resources, such as servers and storage, over the internet. 
      Examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

PaaS(Platform as a service) provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications over the internet. 
      Examples of PaaS providers include AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, and Google App Engine.
      Platform as a service (PaaS) is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for
         a complete and deployed solution (software as a service).     
      
SaaS(Software as a service) provides access to software applications over the internet. 
     Examples of SaaS providers include Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365, and Google G Suite.

THE CORE ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENET OF AZURE 

.The physical infrastructure for Azure starts with datacenters. 
  Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters. 
  They’re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
.A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together
  with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.
.Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. 
  Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. 
  An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. 
  Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.
    Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.
    Azure services that support availability zones fall into three categories:
           1. Zonal services: You pin the resource to a specific zone (for example, VMs, managed disks, IP addresses).
           2. Zone-redundant services: The platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone-redundant storage, SQL Database).
           3. Non-regional services: Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages.

Region pair is a combination of two regions that are connected with low-latency, high-throughput network connections.
  These region pairs are designed to provide a high-availability and disaster recovery solution for applications and data that need to be replicated 
  across regions.
Additional advantages of region pairs:
.If an extensive Azure outage occurs, one region out of every pair is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible for
    applications hosted in that region pair.
.Planned Azure updates are rolled out to paired regions one region at a time to minimize downtime and risk of application outage.
.Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax- and law-enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

Sovereign regions in Azure are regions that are physically located within a specific country or territory and operated by a subsidiary or partner
 of Microsoft, rather than by Microsoft itself. 
 
Azure sovereign regions include:
1. US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa and more: These regions are physical and logical network-isolated instances of Azure for U.S. government
    agencies and partners. These datacenters are operated by screened U.S. personnel and include additional compliance certifications.
2. China East, China North, and more: These regions are available through a unique partnership between Microsoft and 21Vianet, whereby Microsoft doesn't
    directly maintain the datacenters.

A resource is the basic building block of Azure. Anything you create, provision, deploy, etc. is a resource. 
    Virtual Machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, cognitive services, etc. are all considered resources within Azure.

Some examples of how you could use management groups might be:
1. Create a hierarchy that applies a policy. You could limit VM locations to the US West Region in a group called Production. 
    This policy will inherit onto all the subscriptions that are descendants of that management group and will apply to all VMs under those subscriptions. 
    This security policy can't be altered by the resource or subscription owner, which allows for improved governance.
2. Provide user access to multiple subscriptions. By moving multiple subscriptions under a management group, you can create one Azure role-based access
    control (Azure RBAC) assignment on the management group. Assigning Azure RBAC at the management group level means that all sub-management groups, 
    subscriptions, resource groups, and resources underneath that management group would also inherit those permissions. One assignment on the management
    group can enable users to have access to everything they need instead of scripting Azure RBAC over different subscriptions.

VMs are an ideal choice when you need:
                                 Total control over the operating system (OS).
                                 The ability to run custom software.
                                 To use custom hosting configurations.

A virtual machine scale set is a group of identical, load-balanced virtual machines in Azure that automatically increase or decrease in number based
     on demand. This allows for easy scaling of applications and services, and enables high availability and automatic patching and updates

Availability sets are designed to ensure that VMs stagger updates and have varied power and network connectivity, 
      preventing you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure.

Availability sets do this by grouping VMs in two ways: update domain and fault domain - 
.Update domain: The update domain groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time. This allows you to apply updates while knowing that only one 
           update domain grouping will be offline at a time. All of the machines in one update domain will be updated.
           An update group going through the update process is given a 30-minute time to recover before maintenance on the next update domain starts.
.Fault domain: The fault domain groups your VMs by common power source and network switch. By default, an availability set will split your VMs
            across up to three fault domains. This helps protect against a physical power or networking failure by having VMs in different fault domains
            (thus being connected to different power and networking resources).


Some common examples or use cases for virtual machines include:
-During testing and development. VMs provide a quick and easy way to create different OS and application configurations. 
           Test and development personnel can then easily delete the VMs when they no longer need them.
-When running applications in the cloud. The ability to run certain applications in the public cloud as opposed to creating a traditional infrastructure
           to run them can provide substantial economic benefits. For example, an application might need to handle fluctuations in demand. Shutting 
           down VMs when
           you don't need them or quickly starting them up to meet a sudden increase in demand means you pay only for the resources you use.
-When extending your datacenter to the cloud: An organization can extend the capabilities of its own on-premises network by creating a virtual network
           in Azure and adding VMs to that virtual network. Applications like SharePoint can then run on an Azure VM instead of running locally.
           This arrangement makes it easier or less expensive to deploy than in an on-premises environment.
-During disaster recovery: As with running certain types of applications in the cloud and extending an on-premises network to the cloud,
           you can get significant cost savings by using an IaaS-based approach to disaster recovery. If a primary datacenter fails, you can create VMs running
           on Azure to run your critical applications and then shut them down when the primary datacenter becomes operational again.
