Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.
Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking.

You’ll always be responsible for:
.The information and data stored in the cloud
.Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
.The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:
.The physical datacenter
.The physical network
.The physical hosts

Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:
.Operating systems
.Network controls
.Applications
.Identity and infrastructure

The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.


Public Cloud : A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. 
           .No capital expenditures to scale up
           .Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
           .Organizations pay only for what they use	
           .Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security	
Private Cloud : A private cloud is a type of cloud computing infrastructure that is dedicated to a single organization. 
           .Organizations have complete control over resources and security
           .Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data	
           .Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance	
           .Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates	
Hybrid Cloud : A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment.
           .Provides the most flexibility
           .Organizations determine where to run their applications
           .Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements

A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers.
Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.
