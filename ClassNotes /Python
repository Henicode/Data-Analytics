Sets - type of collection 
     - they are unordered 
     - do not contain duplicates 

conditions and branching 
Write an if statement to determine if an album came out before 1980 or in the years: 1991 or 1993. If the condition is true print out the year the album came out.

album = 1999
     if (album < 1980 or album == 1991 or album == 1993):
         print("Your album came out in the year:", album)
     else :
          print("None of those years")
    
A function is a reusable block of code which performs operations specified in the function. They let you break down tasks and allow you to reuse your code in different programs.

There are two types of functions :

     Pre-defined functions
     User defined functions
     
     
     
  Variables
     The input to a function is called a formal parameter.

     A variable that is declared inside a function is called a local variable. The parameter only exists within the function
          (i.e. the point where the function starts and stops).

     A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout the program.
          We will discuss more about global variables at the end of the lab.
