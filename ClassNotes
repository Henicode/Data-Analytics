                    Descriptive Analytics which provides insights into past events 
                    Diagnostic Analytics takes the insights from descrptive analytics to dig deeper to find the cause of the outcome
                    Predictive Analytics leverages historical data and trends to predict future outcomes
                    Prescriptive Analytics analyzes past decisions and events to estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.
                    
Analysis Process - 
       .Understanding the problem and desired result - defining where you are and where you want to be
       .Setting a clear metric - deciding what will be measured and how it will be measured 
       .Gathering data - identifying data you require, the sources from which you will access this data, and the best tool for the job
       .Cleaning data - fixing quality issues in the data and standardizing data coming in from multiple sources
       .Analyzzing and mining data - extracting, analyzing, and manipulating data from different perespectives to understand trends identify
                                     correlations, and find patterns and variations
       .Interpreting results - interpreting results, evaluating defendability of analysis and circumastances under which analysis may not hold true
       .Presenting your findings - communicating and presenting your findings in clear, imapctful, and convincing ways 
  
  
Analysis - detailed examination of the elements or structure of something
