                non-rantional data stores.
Data Analyst - Inspect and clean data for derving insights, identify correlations, find patterns, and apply statistical methods to analyze and mine data,
                visualize data to interpret and present the findings of data analysis. 
                
                
Types of analysis -
                    Descriptive Analytics which provides insights into past events. “What happened.” 
                    Diagnostic Analytics takes the insights from descrptive analytics to dig deeper to find the cause of the outcome. “Why it happened.” 
                    Predictive Analytics leverages historical data and trends to predict future outcomes. “What will happen next.” 
                    Prescriptive Analytics analyzes past decisions and events to estimate the likelihood of different outcomes. “What should be done next.” 
                    
Analysis Process - 
       .Understanding the problem and desired result - defining where you are and where you want to be
       .Setting a clear metric - deciding what will be measured and how it will be measured 
       .Gathering data - identifying data you require, the sources from which you will access this data, and the best tool for the job
       .Cleaning data - fixing quality issues in the data and standardizing data coming in from multiple sources
       .Analyzing and mining data - extracting, analyzing, and manipulating data from different perespectives to understand trends identify
                                     correlations, and find patterns and variations
       .Interpreting results - interpreting results, evaluating defendability of analysis and circumastances under which analysis may not hold true
       .Presenting your findings - communicating and presenting your findings in clear, imapctful, and convincing ways 

Cloud computing is the emerging technology that has made it possible for every enterprise to have access to limitless storage and high-performance computing.
                With cloud computing, businesses can store, manage, and process large amounts of data in a remote, centralized location.  
                
                
Analysis - detailed examination of the elements or structure of something

Analytics - the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics
